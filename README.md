# BASYS3-VGA-ANIMATION
Basys3 VGA Animation project

main.py generates ROM files from .jpg images that can be laoded into the ROM component in the simlator 'Digital'
empty-heart , half-heart, and full-heart are the 3 images to be loaded to make an animation

heart-animation-graphic-ram.dig is a simulation compatible version of the circuit so that you can see what should be dislpayed on your VGA output'''
heart-animation.dig is the file that can be exported to VHDL by digital, uplaoded into Vivado, synthesiszed, pins assigned, and flashed to the basys3 board.
